"""Every shipped module has to parse on the oldest Python the integration claims.

A syntax error is not a bug that degrades a feature — Home Assistant cannot import
the integration at all, and the user gets a traceback instead of a config flow. The
manual install route documented in the README has no version gate whatsoever, so
nothing but this test stands between a newer grammar and that failure.

`ast.parse(feature_version=...)` applies the older grammar without needing the older
interpreter, so this runs on the same 3.14 as everything else.
